How to Create the Blocks Texture Atlas

The game expects a file named 'blocks.png' in this directory, formatted as a 4x4 texture atlas.

Instructions:
1. Create a new image of 256x256 pixels (64x64 pixels per block texture)
2. Divide the image into a 4x4 grid (16 cells total)
3. Fill each cell with a different texture according to this layout:

Row 0:
- (0,0): Dirt texture (brown)
- (1,0): Stone texture (gray)
- (2,0): Grass texture (green top, brown sides)
- (3,0): Sand texture (light yellow)

Row 1:
- (0,1): Wood texture (brown with lines)
- (1,1): Leaves texture (dark green)
- (2,1): Water texture (blue with alpha for transparency)
- (3,1): Brick texture (reddish with mortar lines)

Rows 2-3:
- Additional textures for future use

Format:
- PNG format with RGBA channels
- Each texture should be 64x64 pixels
- Total image size: 256x256 pixels

Until you create this file, the game will use fallback solid colors for each block type.
